# Neural-Network
## Welcome!!
This repository is an ongoing work of implementing neural network in Python 3.
We have tried to keep the function and variable names similar to [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [torch](http://torch.ch/). This repository will be updated regularly so stay tuned.
