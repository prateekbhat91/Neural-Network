# Neural-Network
## Welcome!!
This repository is an ongoing work of implementing neural network in Python.

We have tried to keep the function and variable names similar to [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [keras](https://keras.io/). This repository will be updated regularly so stay tuned.
